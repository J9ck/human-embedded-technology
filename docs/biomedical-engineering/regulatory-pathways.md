# 📋 Regulatory Pathways for Medical Devices

> **FDA approval processes and clinical trial requirements**

Medical device regulation ensures safety and efficacy before commercial use.

## 🏛️ FDA Classification

### Class I (Low Risk)
- Examples: Bandages, stethoscopes
- Requirement: General controls
- No premarket approval needed

### Class II (Moderate Risk)
- Examples: Powered wheelchairs, infusion pumps
- Requirement: **510(k) clearance** (most common)
- Demonstrate "substantial equivalence" to predicate device
- Timeline: 3-12 months

### Class III (High Risk)
- Examples: Pacemakers, implantable BCIs
- Requirement: **Premarket Approval (PMA)**
- Clinical trials required
- Timeline: 1-3+ years

## 🔬 Clinical Trial Phases

### Phase 1: Safety (First-in-Human)
- Participants: 10-30
- Duration: 6-12 months
- Goal: Establish safety, dosing

### Phase 2: Efficacy
- Participants: 50-200
- Duration: 1-2 years
- Goal: Preliminary efficacy data

### Phase 3: Pivotal Trial
- Participants: 200-1000+
- Duration: 2-5 years
- Goal: Statistically significant efficacy
- Required for PMA approval

## 🌍 International Regulations

### CE Marking (Europe)
- Medical Device Regulation (MDR) 2017/745
- Notified Body assessment
- Generally faster than FDA

### ISO Standards
- ISO 10993: Biocompatibility testing
- ISO 14971: Risk management
- ISO 13485: Quality management system

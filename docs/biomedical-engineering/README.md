## 🔗 Integration with Other Disciplines

### → Computer Science
BME provides hardware constraints:
- Biocompatible packaging affects heat dissipation
- Electrode impedance affects signal quality
- Size constraints drive miniaturization

### → Artificial Intelligence
BME enables data collection:
- Electrode arrays capture neural signals
- Sensor fusion for robust measurements
- Clinical validation datasets

## 🎯 Key Design Considerations

1. **Biocompatibility**: Non-toxic, non-immunogenic materials
2. **Hermeticity**: Sealed against body fluids (IP68+)
3. **Sterilization**: Withstand autoclave/gamma radiation
4. **MRI Compatibility**: Non-ferromagnetic materials
5. **Long-Term Stability**: 5-10 year lifetime

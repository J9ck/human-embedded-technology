# 🏛️ Regulatory Quick Reference

> **FDA and CE marking pathways for medical devices**

## FDA Approval Pathways (United States)

### 510(k) Clearance
**Most common pathway for Class II devices**

- Demonstrate "substantial equivalence" to predicate device
- Timeline: 3-12 months
- Cost: $50,000 - $200,000
- Clinical data: Often not required (bench + animal may suffice)
- Examples: ECG monitors, infusion pumps

### Premarket Approval (PMA)
**Required for Class III devices (highest risk)**

- Rigorous scientific evidence of safety and efficacy
- Timeline: 1-3+ years
- Cost: $500,000 - $5,000,000+
- Clinical data: Prospective clinical trial required
- Examples: Pacemakers, implantable BCIs, DBS systems

### De Novo Classification
**New device with no predicate (Class I/II)**

- For novel low-moderate risk devices
- Timeline: 6-18 months
- Establishes new device category
- Examples: First BCI for ALS communication

## CE Marking (European Union)

### Medical Device Regulation (MDR) 2017/745

| Class | Risk | Requirements | Example |
|-------|------|--------------|---------|
| **Class I** | Low | Self-certification | Bandages |
| **Class IIa** | Low-medium | Notified Body involvement | Blood pressure monitors |
| **Class IIb** | Medium-high | Notified Body + clinical data | Infusion pumps |
| **Class III** | High | Full Notified Body assessment | Pacemakers, neural implants |

**Timeline**: Generally 6-18 months (faster than FDA)

## ISO Standards for Medical Devices

### Key Standards

- **ISO 13485**: Quality management system (required)
- **ISO 14971**: Risk management
- **IEC 60601**: Electrical safety for medical equipment
- **ISO 10993**: Biocompatibility testing
- **IEC 62304**: Medical device software lifecycle

---

## Clinical Trial Phases

| Phase | Purpose | Participants | Duration |
|-------|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Phase 1** | Safety (first-in-human) | 10-30 | 6-12 months |
| **Phase 2** | Preliminary efficacy | 50-200 | 1-2 years |
| **Phase 3** | Pivotal trial | 200-1000+ | 2-5 years |
| **Phase 4** | Post-market surveillance | Varies | Ongoing |

## Key Considerations for Neural Implants

### Safety
- Biocompatibility (ISO 10993)
- Sterilization validation
- MRI compatibility assessment
- Electrical safety (charge density limits)

### Efficacy
- Primary endpoint clearly defined
- Statistical power calculation
- Independent data monitoring committee
- Intent-to-treat analysis

### Manufacturing
- Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)
- Design controls (21 CFR Part 820)
- Traceability (unique device identifiers)

## Regulatory Strategy Tips

1. **Early Engagement**: Pre-submission meetings with FDA
2. **Predicate Search**: Find suitable predicate for 510(k)
3. **Risk Analysis**: Thorough ISO 14971 risk assessment
4. **Clinical Plan**: Design robust clinical protocol
5. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive technical files
6. **Quality System**: Implement ISO 13485 from day one
